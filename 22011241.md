
Solution By Steps
# Step 1: 
- I Defined processArray Function
- i Defined a function named processArray that takes an array of numbers as input.
# Step 2: 
- I Processed Array Elements
- Then I Iterate through the input array:
- If the number is even, I squared it.
- If the number is odd, I tripled it.
- I Stored the modified numbers in a new array.
# Step 3:
- I Returned the Modified Array
- I Returned the new array with even numbers squared and odd numbers tripled.
# Step 4: 
- I Defined the formatArrayStrings Function
- I Defined a function named formatArrayStrings that takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers.
# Step 5: 
- I Modified the Strings Based on Numbers
- Then I Iterate through the string array and the corresponding number array:
- If the number is even, I capitalize the entire string.
- If the number is odd, I convert the string to lowercase.
# Step 6:
- I Returned Modified String Array
- I Returned the array of modified strings based on the numbers.
# Step 7: 
- I Defined createUserProfiles Function
- Then I Define a function named createUserProfiles that takes an array of names and an array of modified names.
# Step 8: 
- I Created Array of Objects
- Then Iterate through the arrays and create objects with originalName, modifiedName, and auto-incremented id.
# Step 9: 
- Finally I Returned Array of Objects
- Then Returned the array of objects containing the required information.
